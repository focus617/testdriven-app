Learn how to build, test, and deploy microservices powered by Docker, Flask, and React!

In this course, you will learn how to quickly spin up a reproducible development environment with Docker to manage a number of microservices. Once the app is up and running locally, you'll learn how to deploy it to an Amazon EC2 instance. Finally, we'll look at scaling the services on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and adding AWS Lambda.

We'll also be practicing test-driven development (TDD), writing tests first when it makes sense to do so. The focus will be on server-side unit, functional, and integration tests along with end-to-end tests to ensure the entire system works as expected.

What will you build?

Services:

1.users - Flask app for managing users and auth

2.client - client-side, React app

3.nginx - reverse proxy web server

4.swagger - Swagger API docs

5.scores - Flask app for managing user scores

6.exercises - Flask app for managing exercises
